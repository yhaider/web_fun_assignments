This is the first exam taken by student at Coding Dojo.
It is given at the end of the first week to assess a studentâ€™s knowledge on HTML and CSS.

While I cannot provide a screenshot of the exam instructions for your comparison, I can provide the grading and comments I received from my instructor after grading. You can find my rubric in this folder.
